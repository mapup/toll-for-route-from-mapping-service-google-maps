# [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?hl=en)

### Get key to access Google Maps APIs (if you have an API key skip this)
#### Step 1: Get API Key
* Create an account to access [Google Developer API Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
* go to signup/login link https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?hl=en
* you may need to add Billing Account. In that case make sure you select
  Currency as USD. 
* you will need to agree to Google's Terms of Service https://developers.google.com/terms

#### Step 2: Create project
* Login to your google api dashboard
* Click on Credentials and Create Credentials ( Create Credentials > Api key ) for the above API
* [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

#### Step 3: Enable API
* Go to [Google API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) and 
* active at least Google Maps API 
* If you prefer you can enable Places API and Geocoding API


With this in place, make a GET request:'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin={a}&destination={b}&key={c}'.format(a=source,b=destination,c=token)'

### Note:
Google Maps API Response doesn't have the complete polyline for the route. 
The response includes *overview_polyline* which is an approximate (smoothed) path of the resulting directions.
We stitch the exact polyline for the whole route by piecing together polyline from each step using the code below.

```php

//extracting polyline from the JSON response..
$data_gmaps = json_decode($response, true);

//polyline..
$polyline_gmaps = $data_gmaps['routes']['0']['overview_polyline']['points'];


```

```php
//using googlemaps API

//from & to location..
$from = 'Mainstr,Dallas,TX';
$to = 'Addison,TX';
$key = 'googleapi_key';

$url = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin='.$from.'&destination='.$to.'&key='.$key.'';

//connection..
$ggle = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ggle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, false);
curl_setopt($ggle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);

curl_setopt($ggle, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ggle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

//getting response from googleapis..
$response = curl_exec($ggle);
$err = curl_error($ggle);

curl_close($ggle);

if ($err) {
	  echo "cURL Error #:" . $err;
} else {
	  echo "200 : OK\n";
}

//extracting polyline from the JSON response..
$data_gmaps = json_decode($response, true);

//polyline..
$polyline_gmaps = $data_gmaps['routes']['0']['overview_polyline']['points'];

```

Note:

We extracted the polyline for a route from Google Maps API

We need to send this route polyline to TollGuru API to receive toll information

## [TollGuru API](https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/)

### Get key to access TollGuru polyline API
* create a dev account to receive a free key from TollGuru https://tollguru.com/developers/get-api-key
* suggest adding `vehicleType` parameter. Tolls for cars are different than trucks and therefore if `vehicleType` is not specified, may not receive accurate tolls. For example, tolls are generally higher for trucks than cars. If `vehicleType` is not specified, by default tolls are returned for 2-axle cars. 
* Similarly, `departure_time` is important for locations where tolls change based on time-of-the-day and it can be passed in `$postdata` array.

the last line can be changed to following

```php
//using tollguru API..
$curl = curl_init();

curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, false);
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);


$postdata = array(
	"source" => "google",
	"polyline" => $polyline_gmaps
);

//json encoding source and polyline to send as postfields..
$encode_postData = json_encode($postdata);

curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
CURLOPT_URL => "https://dev.tollguru.com/v1/calc/route",
CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
CURLOPT_ENCODING => "",
CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 10,
CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 30,
CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION => CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1,
CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST => "POST",


//sending gmaps polyline to tollguru
CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => $encode_postData,
CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => array(
    "content-type: application/json"
    "x-api-key: tollguruapi_key"),
));

$response = curl_exec($curl);
$err = curl_error($curl);

curl_close($curl);

if ($err) {
	  echo "cURL Error #:" . $err;
} else {
	  echo "200 : OK\n";
}

//response from tollguru..
$data = var_dump(json_decode($response, true));
print_r($data);

```

The working code can be found in `php_curl_gmaps.php` file.
