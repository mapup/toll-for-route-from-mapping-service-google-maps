# [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?hl=en)

### Get key to access Google Maps APIs (if you have an API key skip this)
#### Step 1: Get API Key
* Create an account to access [Google Developer API Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
* go to signup/login link https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?hl=en
* you may need to add Billing Account. In that case make sure you select
  Currency as USD. 
* you will need to agree to Google's Terms of Service https://developers.google.com/terms

#### Step 2: Create project
* Login to your google api dashboard
* Click on Credentials and Create Credentials ( Create Credentials > Api key ) for the above API
* [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

#### Step 3: Enable API
* Go to [Google API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) and 
* active at least Google Maps API 
* If you prefer you can enable Places API and Geocoding API

With this in place, make a GET request: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=${source.latitude},${source.longitude}&destination=${destination.latitude},${destination.longitude}&key=${key}

### Note:
Google Maps API Response doesn't have the complete polyline for the route. 
The response includes *overview_polyline* which is an approximate (smoothed) path of the resulting directions.
We stitch the exact polyline for the whole route by piecing together polyline from each step using the code below.

```javascript

// JSON path "$..points"
const getSteps = body => body.routes
  .map(x => x.legs)
  .reduce(flatten)
  .map(x => x.steps)
  .reduce(flatten)
  .map(x => x.polyline.points)
```

```javascript
const request = require("request");
const polyline = require("polyline");

// REST API key from MapmyIndia
const key = process.env.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;
const tollguruKey = process.env.TOLLGURU_KEY;

const source = 'Dallas, TX'

const destination = 'New York, NY';

const url = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=${source}&destination=${destination}&key=${key}`;


const head = arr => arr[0]
const flatten = (arr, x) => arr.concat(x)
// JSON path "$..points"
const getPoints = body => body.routes
  .map(x => x.legs)
  .reduce(flatten)
  .map(x => x.steps)
  .reduce(flatten)
  .map(x => x.polyline.points)
  .map(x => polyline.decode(x))
  .reduce(flatten)
const getPolyline = body => polyline.encode(getPoints(JSON.parse(body)));

const getRoute = (cb) => request.get(url, cb);

const handleRoute = (e, r, body) => console.log(getPolyline(body))

getRoute(handleRoute)
```

Note:

We extracted the polyline for a route from Google Maps API

We need to send this route polyline to TollGuru API to receive toll information

## [TollGuru API](https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/)

### Get key to access TollGuru polyline API
* create a dev account to receive a free key from TollGuru https://tollguru.com/developers/get-api-key
* suggest adding `vehicleType` parameter. Tolls for cars are different than trucks and therefore if `vehicleType` is not specified, may not receive accurate tolls. For example, tolls are generally higher for trucks than cars. If `vehicleType` is not specified, by default tolls are returned for 2-axle cars. 
* Similarly, `departure_time` is important for locations where tolls change based on time-of-the-day.

the last line can be changed to following

```javascript

const tollguruUrl = 'https://dev.tollguru.com/v1/calc/route';

const handleRoute = (e, r, body) =>  {

  console.log(body);
  const _polyline = getPolyline(body);
  console.log(_polyline);

  request.post(
    {
      url: tollguruUrl,
      headers: {
        'content-type': 'application/json',
        'x-api-key': tollguruKey
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        source: "google",
        polyline: _polyline,
        vehicleType: "2AxlesAuto",
        departure_time: "2021-01-05T09:46:08Z"
      })
    },
    (e, r, body) => {
      console.log(e);
      console.log(body)
    }
  )
}

getRoute(handleRoute);
```
