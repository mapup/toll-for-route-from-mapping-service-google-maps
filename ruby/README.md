# [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?hl=en)

### Get key to access Google Maps APIs (if you have an API key skip this)
#### Step 1: Get API Key
* Create an account to access [Google Developer API Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
* go to signup/login link https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?hl=en
* you may need to add Billing Account. In that case make sure you select
  Currency as USD. 
* you will need to agree to Google's Terms of Service https://developers.google.com/terms

#### Step 2: Create project
* Login to your google api dashboard
* Click on Credentials and Create Credentials ( Create Credentials > Api key ) for the above API
* [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

#### Step 3: Enable API
* Go to [Google API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) and 
* active at least Google Maps API 
* If you prefer you can enable Places API and Geocoding API

With this in place, make a GET request: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=${source.latitude},${source.longitude}&destination=${destination.latitude},${destination.longitude}&key=${key}

### Note:
Google Maps API Response doesn't have the complete polyline for the route. 
The response includes *overview_polyline* which is an approximate (smoothed) path of the resulting directions.
We stitch the exact polyline for the whole route by piecing together polyline from each step using the code below.

```ruby
# Decoding polyline pieces and encoding back after combining all pieces
polyline_piece = json_parsed['routes'].map { |x| x['legs'] }.flatten.map { |y| y['steps']}.flatten.map { |z| z['polyline']['points']}
coord_decoded = polyline_piece.map {|x| FastPolylines.decode(x)}.flatten(1)
google_encoded_polyline = FastPolylines.encode(coord_decoded)
```

```ruby
require 'HTTParty'
require 'json'
require "fast_polylines"

# Source Details
SOURCE = 'Dallas, TX'
# Destination Details
DESTINATION = 'New York, NY'

# GET Request to Google for Polyline Pieces
KEY = ENV['GOOGLEAPI_KEY']
google_url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=#{SOURCE}&destination=#{DESTINATION}&key=#{KEY}"
RESPONSE = HTTParty.get(google_url).body
json_parsed = JSON.parse(RESPONSE)
```

Note:

We extracted the polyline for a route from Google Maps API

We need to send this route polyline to TollGuru API to receive toll information

## [TollGuru API](https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/)

### Get key to access TollGuru polyline API
* create a dev account to receive a free key from TollGuru https://tollguru.com/developers/get-api-key
* suggest adding `vehicleType` parameter. Tolls for cars are different than trucks and therefore if `vehicleType` is not specified, may not receive accurate tolls. For example, tolls are generally higher for trucks than cars. If `vehicleType` is not specified, by default tolls are returned for 2-axle cars. 
* Similarly, `departure_time` is important for locations where tolls change based on time-of-the-day.

the last line can be changed to following

```ruby
# Sending POST request to TollGuru
TOLLGURU_URL = 'https://apis.tollguru.com/toll/v2/complete-polyline-from-mapping-service'
TOLLGURU_KEY = ENV['TOLLGURU_KEY']
headers = {'content-type' => 'application/json', 'x-api-key' => TOLLGURU_KEY}
body = {'source' => "google", 'polyline' => google_encoded_polyline, 'vehicleType' => "2AxlesAuto", 'departure_time' => "2021-01-05T09:46:08Z"}
tollguru_response = HTTParty.post(TOLLGURU_URL,:body => body.to_json, :headers => headers, :timeout => 60)
```

The working code can be found in main.rb file.
